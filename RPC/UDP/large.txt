Welcome to the file!! This is a web page that is being displayed. This file is longer than 500 bytes file that is created to test the web browser. Http protocol is an application layer protocol that is hosted at the layer 7 of the OSI model. The other layers are going from bottom to top , physical , data link, network, transport, session, presentation layer. This web server will be tested With its own client and with browser. Lots of fun designing this project and lots of learning.In this program a RPC client has been designed that sends a request to the RPC server requesting to fetch a file that is present in the server. RPC helps to locate another computer on a network without having to understand the networks details. As it is RPC, Now the client would request for the specific file. The server would search for the file and if found it will return the file to the client.Client receives three arguments one is the default client argument, next is the host ip address or the host name and the third is the filename that must be retrieved from the server.By using the host ip and file name as the input, the main function calls the file_server_1 function that has been created by the generator and receives the file from the server
